# Project Outline

Minibatch Learning + Stochastic Gradient Descent

## Goal

Build a Image Classification System:

- MLP model:
  - Library Style
- How to run
- Example on Jupyter Notebook

Personal Goal: Show my quantitative skills and my ML skills

### Apply it on both CIFAR-10 and MNIST

- Obtain and preprocess the data

## Config / Settings

- Layer Specs
- Activation Function
  - sigmoid
  - tanh
  - ReLU
  - output
- Batch Size
- epochs
- regularization coefficient for L1 and L2
- momentum
